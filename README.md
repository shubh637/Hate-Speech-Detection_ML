# Hate Speech Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview

The Hate Speech Detection project aims to classify text data into categories such as "hate speech" and "non-hate speech" using machine learning techniques. The model analyzes textual data to identify and filter out hateful or offensive language.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Gathers and preprocesses text data, including hate speech and non-hate speech examples.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Involves tokenization, stopword removal, and text normalization.
- **Feature Extraction**: Uses techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings to convert text into numerical features.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to detect hate speech.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measures model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
